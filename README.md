# Draw Maps, Leave Blanks

When playing tabletop RPGs with homebrew campaigns, you want to be able to map the adventure so far without limiting any options for surprises and improvisation.  This project will eventually allow users to plop different icons and text onto the canvas; objects on the map can be dragged around and edited as needed, and saved for future reference.

So far I've made some headway on the interface - the user double-clicks a location on the map, and a popup is presented with different options for icons to add at that location.  Right now, the user can add some dummy cowboy sprites to the map.
